sysfuzz is a program that attempts to perform fuzz testing of the FreeBSD
kernel's system call interface. Naive fuzz testing of this interface wouldn't
be very interesting: system calls with random input will fail parameter
validation the vast majority of the time, so it would be mostly limited to
exposing very basic bugs in system call implementations.

This program attempts to improve on the naive approach by using knowledge of
individual system call arguments to generate valid input. For example, rather
than using random numbers for the first two arguments to ptrace(2), sysfuzz uses
a valid ptrace command for the first argument, and a valid PID for the second
argument. During start-up, sysfuzz allocates various types of resources (e.g.
sockets, child processes, kqueues) for use in system call parameter generation.

Brag list. Here are bugs that I've found using sysfuzz:
